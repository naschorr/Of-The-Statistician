# Of The Statistician

It's a WoW addon that helps you find out pricing information (Minimum, Average, Maximum) of a given item's alternative random enchantments. To do this, it uses Auctionator's API (and database) to look at the selling prices for all potential enchantments of an item. It then sticks this information in the tooltip of the item you've hovered over.

Basically, instead of just looking at this:

![without OTS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naschorr/Of-The-Statistician/master/images/withoutOTS.png)

and seeing that the current auction price is ~99 gold, you'll see this:

![with OTS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naschorr/Of-The-Statistician/master/images/withOTS.png)
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naschorr/Of-The-Statistician/master/images/highlightOTS.png" alt="with OTS highlighted" width="406" height="225">

and notice that the cheapest [Lord's Cape of XYZ] is selling for much less than 99 gold. Therefore, it's unlikely that someone interested in buying that design would purchase your auction. This means that you don't have to waste gold or time listing the auction.
